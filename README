A program to check a sudoku solution.

The program can either read a completed sudoku from a file,
or the user can choose to input all the values manually.

If a filename is not given as argument or if the passed file 
could not be opened, the program asks for input by user.

eg :

  $ ./sudoku sudoku-file

reads input the numbers from the file 'sudoku-file'

  $ ./sudoku

asks for user input.
